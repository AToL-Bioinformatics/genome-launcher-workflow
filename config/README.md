# {{ dataset_id }}.{{ assembly_version }}

This repository contains the workflows that were used to assemble the genome
{{ dataset_id }}.{{ assembly_version}} for *{{ scientific_name }}*.

The repo was produced automatically from boilerplate code at
[AToL-Bioinformatics/genome-launcher-workflow](https://github.com/AToL-Bioinformatics/genome-launcher-workflow).

## Overview

The assembly process has three main steps:

1. Assembly with
   [sanger-tol/genomeassembly](https://github.com/sanger-tol/genomeassembly/)
2. Decontamination with [sanger-tol/ascc](https://github.com/sanger-tol/ascc/)
3. Preparation of curation materials with
   [sanger-tol/treeval](https://github.com/sanger-tol/treeval/), if there are
   Hi-C reads.

The config files for these steps are in the [config](./config) directory.

The sanger-tol workflows are plumbed together by the [included Snakemake
worfklow](./workflow/Snakefile).

## Running the assembly

### Setting up

Clone this repo to the HPC where it will be run.

A profile will be needed to configure the job scheduler on the HPC. Profiles
for [Setonix](./profiles/pawsey) and [Spartan (partial)](./profiles/spartan)
are included. A profile for [local testing](./profiles/local) is also included.

<details>

<summary>More information about the profile</summary>

#### The profile needs at least the following files:

- Snakemake [**job config**](./profiles/pawsey/config.v9+.yaml) and [**workflow
  config**](./profiles/pawsey/workflow.config.yaml): configure the jobs from the
  genome-launcher-workflow.
- [**nextflow config**](./profiles/pawsey/pawsey.config): configure the
  processes from the Sanger-Tol pipelines
- [**ascc.params.config**](./profiles/pawsey/ascc.params.config): the [YAML
  params
  file](https://pipelines.tol.sanger.ac.uk/ascc/0.6.0/usage#running-the-pipeline)
  for ASCC (not shared with the other pipelines).

</details>

### Steps

1. Download the reads and run the QC scripts using the genome-launcher-workflow
   target `pre_genomeassembly`.
2. Run the `genomeassembly` workflow. See the [example 20_genomeassembly.sh
   script](profiles/pawsey/20_genomeassembly.sh).
3. Stage the ASCC reference data using the genome-launcher-workflow target
   `post_genomeassembly`.
4. Run the `ascc` workflow. See the [example 30_ascc.sh
   script](profiles/pawsey/30_ascc.sh).
5. Convert the ASCC output for TreeVal using the genome-launcher-workflow
   target `post_ascc`.
6. If Hi-C is available, run the `treeval` workflow. See the [example
   40_treeval.sh submission script](profiles/pawsey/40_treeval.sh).
7. Run the `post_treeval` target to upload the results to object storage. The
   `post_*` targets all upload the output of the preceding pipeline to object
   storage.

1. Pull the repo:
   1. `git init . `
   2. `git remote add origin https://github.com/AToL-Bioinformatics/{{ dataset_id }}.{{ assembly_version }}.git`
   3. `git pull origin main`
2. Set up the directory structure: `bash profiles/pawsey/00_preflight.sh`
3. Run the workflow steps:
   1. `sbatch profiles/pawsey/10_pre_genomeassembly.sh`
   2. `sbatch profiles/pawsey/20_genomeassembly.sh`
   3. `sbatch profiles/pawsey/25_post_genomeassembly.sh`
   4. `sbatch profiles/pawsey/30_ascc.sh`
   5. `sbatch profiles/pawsey/35_post_ascc.sh`
   6. `sbatch profiles/pawsey/40_treeval.sh`
   7. `sbatch profiles/pawsey/45_post_treeval.sh`
